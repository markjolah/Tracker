\href{https://travis-ci.org/markjolah/Tracker}{\tt } \subsection*{Tracker}

Tracker is a particle tracking trajectory connector tool that is based on a sparse-\/matrix \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem}{\tt linear assignment problem (L\+AP)} solver.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Tracker uses a sparse matrix formulations of the \href{https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=30107}{\tt Jonker-\/\+Volgenant Algorithm}
\item Tracker provides C++ and Matlab object-\/oriented interfaces. \href{http://markolah.pecos.us/Tracker/classtracker_1_1LAPTrack.html}{\tt {\ttfamily tracker\+::\+L\+A\+P\+Track}}
\item Tracker is designed for cross-\/platform complilation to Linux and Windows 64-\/bit targets.

\subsubsection*{Trajectory connection problem}

In single particle tracking applications, a set of likely particles are localized for each frame of a video capture. The goal of trajectory connection is to partition the localizations from all the frames into a set of trajectories. Each trajectory is a sequence of localizations which are likely to be from the same object (point emitter).

The Tracker library implements a two-\/phase strategy to trajectory connection. First a frame-\/to-\/frame algorithm sequentially builds a set of trajectories connecting localizations in adjacent frames, next a gap-\/closing phase connects shorter trajectories across several frames as particles are often not localized in every frame for various reasons including experimental and photo-\/chemical effects.

\subsubsection*{Documentation}

The Tracker Doxygen documentation can be build with the {\ttfamily O\+P\+T\+\_\+\+D\+OC} C\+Make option and is also available on online\+:

\paragraph*{External Projects}

These packages are specialized C\+Make projects. If they are not currently installed, at the start of the build process, the \href{https://github.com/markjolah/UncommonCMakeModules/blob/master/AddExternalDependency.cmake}{\tt Add\+External\+Dependency.\+cmake} will automatically download, configure, build and install C\+Make-\/based projects to the {\ttfamily C\+M\+A\+K\+E\+\_\+\+I\+N\+S\+T\+A\+L\+L\+\_\+\+P\+R\+E\+F\+IX}. This process is completed before C\+Make configure-\/time so calls to the normal {\ttfamily find\+\_\+package()} command are used to find the auto-\/added Dependencies.
